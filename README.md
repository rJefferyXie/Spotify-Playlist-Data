**This was a personal project where I learned how to use the open spotify API (spotipy).**

Given a Spotify Playlist link, this program will gather interesting data like Popularity, Length, Name, Album, Energy, Time Signature, and Tempo,
and then write them to a .csv file for easier consumption of the user.

**To run the spotify_playlist_data_gatherer file, make sure you have the required modules required by entering these commands into your terminal or IDE.**
* *pip install spotipy*
* *pip install spotipy.oauth2*
